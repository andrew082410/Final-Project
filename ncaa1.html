                          <p>The NCAA, a member-led organization, was founded in 1906 to regulate the rules of college sport and protect young athletes.

                            At the start of the 20th century, mass formations and gang tackling gave football a reputation as a brutal sport. During the 1904 season alone, there were 18 deaths and 159 serious injuries on the field. At the college level, hired players not enrolled in school often filled out rosters. Some colleges and universities halted football on their campuses. The public outcry grew for the sport to be reformed or abolished.
                            
                            In October 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt, a longtime football fan, called together athletics leaders from some of the top football schools — Harvard, Princeton and Yale — and urged them to clean up the game. As football deaths and injuries continued to mount during the 1905 season, New York University Chancellor Henry M. MacCracken convened a meeting of 13 schools in December to reform football playing rules. Soon after, on Dec. 28 in New York, 62 colleges and universities became charter members of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, the precursor to the NCAA.
                            
                            The IAAUS officially was constituted as a rules-making body March 31, 1906, and in 1910 was renamed the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Just over a decade later, the Association expanded its focus to host its first national championship: the National Collegiate Track and Field Championships in 1921. Many others followed, including a basketball championship in 1939.</p>

                              <p class="card-text">College basketball takes center stage Saturday with 18 of the Top 25 teams in action. The two marquee matchups of the weekend include No. 1 Arizona traveling to Indianapolis for a showdown with No. 3 Purdue and No. 9 North Carolina facing off with No. 14 Kentucky in the CBS Sports Classic.

                                No. 2 Kansas kicks off the loaded slate on CBS by going on the road to face Indiana. The matchup of historic blue bloods will be the 16th all-time meeting and only the sixth game played between the schools in the last 30 years. The Jayhawks are looking to add another key win to its resume that already includes victories over UConn, Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

          Each year, the top-ranked team in the seasons final NABC Division I Coaches Poll is awarded the coveted NABC National Championship Trophy. The one-of-a-kind Waterford Crystal trophy is presented to the winning head coach following the Division I National Championship Game.

The NABC National Championship Trophy was first awarded in the 1990-91 season.  Since its inception, the trophy has been produced by the Blackdog Group.  The hand-blown trophy, which is cut and polished in Waterford, Ireland, is individually made and takes three months to create. The base of the trophy is a propriety material, Foxite, made by Bruce Fox, Inc.  The trophy is three pieces: crystal ball, crystal support and base.
