                          <p>The EuroLeague, known as the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague for sponsorship reasons, is a European men's professional basketball club competition. The league is widely recognised as the top-tier men's league in Europe.[3][4] The league consists of 18 teams, of which 16 are given long-term licences and wild cards,[5] making the league a semi-closed league.[6][7] The league was first organized by FIBA in 1958, subsequently by ULEB in 2000 and then solely the Euroleague Basketball.

                            The competition was introduced in 1958 as the FIBA European Champions Cup (renamed to the FIBA EuroLeague in 1996), which operated under FIBA's umbrella until Euroleague Basketball was created for the 2000–01 season. The FIBA European Champions Cup and the EuroLeague are considered to be the same competition, with the change of name being simply a re-branding. source:wikipedia</p>

          <strong>Champions Anadolu Efes |</strong> The 2022 EuroLeague Final Four was the concluding EuroLeague Final Four tournament of the 2021–22 EuroLeague season, the 65th season of Europe's premier club basketball tournament, and the 22nd season since it was first organised by Euroleague Basketball. It was the 35th Final Four of the modern EuroLeague Final Four era (1988–present), and the 37th time overall that the competition has concluded with a final four format. The venue initially selected was Berlin, Germany; however, Euroleague Basketball later announced that the Final Four would be played at the Štark Arena in Belgrade, Serbia, on 19–21 May 2022.[1]
