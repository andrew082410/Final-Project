                                   <dl>
                                      <dt>How was Basketball created?</dt>
                                      <dd>
                                        Basketball was first developed in 1891 by James Naismith as a way for athletes to keep in
                                        shape during the winter months in Springfield, Massachusetts. The early basketball games
                                        were played with a soccer-style ball and peach baskets. There was no limit in the number of
                                        players or balls that could be used at once. It was not uncommon to see a game with 50
                                        players and 5 balls. In 1892, Naismith developed 13 simple rules to help govern the game.
                                        Some of these rules are still used today. The rules of the game were published in a national
                                        magazine and its popularity quickly spread throughout the United States. The game grew so
                                        fast that the first intercollegiate basketball game was played in 1896. In 1936, basketball
                                        became an Olympic Sport</dd>
                                      <dt>What is the NBA</dt>
                                      <dd>The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is a professional basketball league comprised of 30 teams across 
                                        North America featuring the best basketball players in the world.</dd>
                                      <dt>When was the NBA establshied?</dt>
                                      <dd>.The National Basketball Association was founded on June 6, 1946 at the Commodore Hotel in New York City. Maurice Podoloff was the leagueâ€™s first president, a title later changed to commissioner. 
                                         Eleven teams were part of that league, originally called the Basketball Association of America.</dd>
                                      <dt>What is the NCAA</dt>
                                      <dd>The National Collegiate Athletic Association is a nonprofit organization that
                                          regulates student athletics among about 1,100 schools in the United States, and Canada</dd>
                                      <dt>What is the EuroLeague</dt>
                                      <dd>The EuroLeague, known as the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague for sponsorship reasons,
                                         is a European men's professional basketball club competition</dd>
                                      <dt>What are the positions of basketball?</dt>
                                      <dd>today each of the five positions is known by a unique name and number: point guard (PG) or 1, the shooting guard (SG) or 2, 
                                        the small forward (SF) or 3, the power forward (PF) or 4, and the center (C) or 5.</dd>
                                      <dt>Does Basketball have a hall of fame for the best players?</dt>
                                      <dd>The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is an American history museum and hall of fame, located at 1000 Hall of Fame Avenue in Springfield, Massachusetts. It serves as basketball's most complete library,

                                      <dt>Are the rules of Basketball the same among all leagues?</dt>
                                      <dd>When talking about differences between American and European basketball we have to consider many aspects, some of them belong to the game of basketball itself, 
                                        and some others have to do with the European environment and expectations set for import players.So yes each league has there own little different rules but ultimately play the game the same way</dd>
                                      <dt>How many Players can be on one team?</dt>
